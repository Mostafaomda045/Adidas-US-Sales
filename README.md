## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard features a multi-panel layout displaying interconnected KPIs and trends for Adidas US operations:
- **Profit by Region**: Bar chart highlighting total profits across key states (Alaska, California, New York, Texas).
- **Sales Method Distribution**: Pie chart showing proportions of retail vs. online sales.
- **Gender Sales Breakdown**: Pie chart illustrating male vs. female product sales shares.
- **Sales Trend by Quarter**: Line graph tracking sales progression over time (e.g., Q1 to Q4).
- **Product Category Sales**: Additional pie chart for product-specific distributions.

Data is sourced from US sales records, enabling interactive filtering by region and time period for deeper analysis.

## Key Insights

Analysis of the dashboard reveals strategic opportunities:
- **Regional Profit Leaders**: California and New York dominate profits, with Texas showing strong bar heights indicating competitive performance; Alaska lags, suggesting potential for targeted expansion.
- **Sales Channel Balance**: Retail sales occupy the majority pie slice (gray/orange), while online (blue) represents a growing but secondary channel—optimize digital marketing to boost online share.
- **Demographic Targeting**: Male demographics claim the largest pie portion (pink/orange), followed by female (blue); tailor inventory and campaigns to sustain male loyalty while capturing female market growth.
- **Quarterly Growth Trajectory**: The line graph shows an upward trend from 2023 Q1 to Q4, with accelerating slopes in later quarters, signaling robust year-over-year sales momentum.
- **Product Focus**: Best-product (likely footwear/apparel) leads the pie chart, underscoring category prioritization for inventory and promotions.
